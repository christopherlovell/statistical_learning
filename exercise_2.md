# Statistical Learning - Chapter 2

## Exercises
### Conceptual
1. For each of parts (a) through (d), indicate whether we would generally expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be better or worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.
    - (a) Sample size *n* is extremely large, and number of perdictors *p* is small.
       - Flexible is better. A flexible model will allow us to take full advantage of our large sample size.
    - (b) Number of predictors *p* is extremely large, and number of observations *n* is small.
        -   Flexible is worse. The flexible model will cause overfitting due to our small sample size.
    - (c) The relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear.
        - flexible is better. An inflexible method will miss the non-linearity effect.
    - (d) The variance of the error terms, i.e. $$\sigma^{2}$$
