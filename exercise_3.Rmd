8. (a) Use the lm() function to perform a simple linear regression with `mpg` as the response and `horsepower` as the predictor. Comment on the output.
```{r}
library(ISLR)
data(Auto)

lm.fit<-lm(mpg~horsepower,data=Auto)
summary(lm.fit)
```

There is a relationship between the predictor and the response, evidenced by the non-zero coefficient for horsepower. The relationship is strong, evidenced by the low p-value. The negative sign of the coefficient indicates a negative relationship. Given a horsepower of 98 the model predicts a value for mpg shown below as `fit`. The lower and upper confidence intervals are also shown.

```{r}
predict(lm.fit,data.frame(horsepower=c(98)),interval="confidence")
```
